A wide variety of mIRC, TCL and Perl scripts.

=============================================

Most of you know how to install mIRC script's into your client, Which is easy enough to do.

TCL script's on the other hand, You have to login to the shell or where ever it is that you're hosting your eggdrop bot.
Navigate yourself to /eggdrop/scripts.. Then nano with a unique file name, and paste the code there.

After you have done that, You need to edit the eggdrop.conf or whatever you have named your config file,
And at the bottom you need to add the line "source scripts/uniquefilename.tcl" Replacing uniquefilename with the name of what you named the file.
